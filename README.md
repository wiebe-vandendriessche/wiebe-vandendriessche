# 👋 Hi, I'm Wiebe Vandendriessche

🎓 I'm a Master's student in **Industrial Sciences: Informatics** at UGent. I'm passionate about **AI transparency**, **system design**, and building tools that bring structure and insight to complex software processes.

🚀 **Currently working on:**  
💡 `AIBoMGen` — my master's thesis project:  
> A tool to generate **AI Bills of Materials** (AIBoMs) that track training data, model dependencies, and compliance with regulations like the EU AI Act.
📚 **Next up:**  
I plan to start a second Master's in **Computer Science** at UGent to dive deeper into **machine learning**, **AI systems**, and **software architecture**.
