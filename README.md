# 👋 Hi, I'm Wiebe Vandendriessche

🎓 I'm a Master's student in **Industrial Sciences: Informatics** at UGent. I'm passionate about **AI transparency**, **system design**, and building tools that bring structure and insight to complex software processes.

🚀 **Currently working on:**  
💡 `AIBoMGen` — my master's thesis project:  
> A tool to generate **AI Bills of Materials** (AIBoMs) that track training data, model dependencies, and compliance with regulations like the EU AI Act.
📚 **Next up:**  
I plan to start a second Master's in **Computer Science** at UGent to dive deeper into **machine learning**, **AI systems**, and **software architecture**.

👔 **Internship Experience:**  
Skyline Communications – DevOps Engineer Intern (Automation & Orchestration)
> Aug 2024 – Sep 2024
During my internship at Skyline Communications, I developed an Integration Test Boundary Manager in .NET. This tool was designed to help DevOps engineers efficiently navigate test environments and configure boundaries for integration tests.

=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
